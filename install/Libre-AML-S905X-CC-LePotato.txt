Web link for the single-board computer: https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/

The Ubuntu image we started with was: ubuntu-22.04.1-preinstalled-base-arm64+aml-s905x-cc.img.xz
downloaded from: https://distro.libre.computer/ci/ubuntu/22.04/

The Libre Computer-AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato) is a single-board computer used to run the authbot.
The software (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS operating system, authbot, and its dependencies) are installed on
a micro SD card image that can be downloaded via ipfs. The ipfs content identifier is:QmdVrdKfW3hCnef82rFMuZ5Xs6h1rVpPn24GXe5od9yspW
Once downloaded the file (named:authbot-template.img.bz2, size: 1.47 GiB) should be expanded (bzip2) and named: authbot-template.img
Then the image written to a micro SD card (16 GB minimum).

You can use dd to write the image to the micro SD card:
sudo dd if=authbot-template.img of=/dev/sdd (use the /dev/??? that your micro SD Card is assigned) bs=1k conv=noerror

Once the image is written, you can insert the micro SD card into the Le Potato, plug in your ethernet cable and power on.

Once your booted up, some configuration needs to be performed:

You will need to create a monero wallet in the /home/user/monero-v0.18.2.2/ directory
I prefer to use monero-wallet-cli to create the wallet:

cd /home/user/monero-v0.18.2.2
./monero-wallet-cli

For simplicity name the wallet: authbot
store the wallet information (25-word mnemonic and password) in a secure offline location in case you need to recreate the wallet.
Then place the wallet password in the pwd.txt file in the /home/user/monero-v0.18.2.2/ directory.

Start the wallet service by issuing the following commands:
sudo systemctl enable wallet.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start wallet.service

Next create an anon ID in your wallet:
curl http://127.0.0.1:18089/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"create_address","params":{"account_index":0,"label":"anon","count":1}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json''

Then create an ID for your authbot:
curl http://localhost:18089/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"create_account","params":{"label":"authbot"}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json''


Make sure you have an account on a matrix protocol (Synapse) homeserver (such as matrix.org). You can goto https://app.element.io to create a new account. You should create 2 accounts, one for you and one for your authbot.

Login to your authbot account in https://app.element.io
create a new private room for your authbot, (You can locate your room id by going to the room "Settings",
"Advanced" tab. "Room Information", "Internal Room ID"). You will want to save your security key for reference in subsequent sessions.

Next configure your authbot (Use the info for the matrix account you created for your authbot):
cd /home/user/matrix-eno-bot
nano config.yaml
uncomment and set the following variables with your values:

command_prefix (your authbot ID from the step above (Then create an ID for your authbot:). Place the ID inside double quotes.
user_id
user_password
homeserver_url
device_id (Uppercase,just create one. Example:AUTHBOT)
device_name (provide a name. Example: authbot)

Save the config.yaml file
Then:
Login to your authbot matrix account.
On the authbot computer:
cd /home/user/matrix-eno-bot
./main.py config.yaml

Your app.element.io session will ask you if you just logged in. Respond in the affirmative.
Next click the icon ("i" in a circle) in the upper right of the web page.
Click on the user_id, then look down in the area labeled "SECURITY". Click on the unverified authbot device, then confirm with emojis.
You will need to interactively verify in the web page as well as your authbot computer terminal.

Once you have confirmed the authbot device, perform the following commands on your authbot computer:
sudo systemctl enable matrix-eno-bot.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start matrix-eno-bot.service

Now your authbot will automatically run at startup.

Next, perform the following commands:
cd /home/user/authbot
matrix-commander --login password
(follow the prompts)

assuming all goes well:

matrix-commander --verify 

Using the web https://app.element.io and your authbot computer terminal, verify the matrix-commander device (like you did above for the authbot)

Finally, edit the authbot.json file in the /home/user/authbot directory.
change the "authbot_owner" value to your (not your authbot) matrix user_id

Then reboot the Le Potato and the authbot should be operational
