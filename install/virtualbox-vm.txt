An authbot virtualbox vm template can be downloaded via ipfs. The ipfs content identifier is: QmQtZyQQEusSy2t4zT8VRm6z6oCp3jhUaqfgCS5som6wD9
The file should be renamed to authbot-v0.0.6.ova in order for it to be imported into VirtualBox.
The SHA 256 verification hash for the file is: 8b98f618a19fbd5f3d904b6671eab4c378a5ee1869fd0051199698cd01237c7f

The virtual machine is configured with Ubuntu Server 22.04.2 LTS configured with 4096 MB RAM, 1 CPU.
The login credential: username: user, password: password (change the password once you login)

The virtual machine has port forwarding enabled so you should be able to ssh to it as follows:
ssh user@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

You will need to create a monero wallet in the /home/user/monero-v0.18.2.2/ directory
For simplicity name the wallet: authbot
Then place the wallet password in the pwd.txt file.

Make sure you have an account on a matrix protocol (Synapse) homeserver (such as matrix.org)
Once you have a working account, create a private room for your authbot, (You can locate your room id by going to the room "Settings",
"Advanced" tab. "Room Information", "Internal Room ID") then perform the following:

cd /home/user/authbot
matrix-commander --login password
(follow the prompts)

assuming all goes well:

matrix-commander --verify 
(I find this is easier to perform (via emoji) on a mobile device)

nano /home/user/authbot/authbot.py

edit the following block:

room = "room " # Enter the default room name you used in matrix-commander --ins>
room_addr = '!' # Enter the room id of the room specified above
room_id = 0 # Public facing digital id room variable
anon_room = "room " # Enter your anonymous digital id private room name
anon_room_addr = "!" # Enter the anonymous digital id private room id
anon_room_id = 1 # Anonymous digital id room variable

assuming your authbot room name is: my-authbot, change the block to:

room = "room my-authbot" # Enter the default room name you used in matrix-commander --ins>
room_addr = '<YOUR_ROOM_ID)' # Enter the room id of the room specified above
room_id = 0 # Public facing digital id room variable
anon_room = "room " # Enter your anonymous digital id private room name
anon_room_addr = "!" # Enter the anonymous digital id private room id
anon_room_id = 1 # Anonymous digital id room variable

You can leave the anon info as it is for now. The authbot code currently provides support for two IDs (public facing, and an anonymous ID). 
If you wish to use an anonymous ID, create another private room for the anonymous ID and enter it's name after "room ", for example if your 
anon room name is "anon" then the line above should be:
anon_room = "room anon"
You will need to place the room_id in the anon_room_addr variable.

You will also need to create a new subaddress in the authbot Monero wallet.

Then:

sudo systemctl enable monerod.service
sudo systemctl enable authbot.service
sudo systemctl enable wallet.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Then reboot the virtual machine and the authbot should be operational
